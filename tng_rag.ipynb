      "In the Star Trek: The Next Generation series, Jean-Luc Picard's dialogue about Data is a recurring theme throughout the show. Here are some quotes and context that illustrate his views on Data:\n",
      "\n",
      "* In Episode 4.0, \"Yesterday's Enterprise\" (Scene: 14), Picard says to Data, \"I am making you aware of the... situation.\" This implies that he thinks Data may be a threat or an anomaly, which is why he wants to inform him.\n",
      "* In Episode 17.0, \"The Measure of a Man\" (Scene: 78), Picard tells Data, \"You are my son, Data.\" This indicates that Picard feels a paternal bond with Data, despite their artificial creation and the fact that they were not biologically related.\n",
      "* In several episodes, including Episode 13.0, \"Tapestry\" (Scene: 26), Picard expresses concern about Data's humanity, particularly in situations where he is faced with tough moral choices. He seems to believe that Data's lack of emotions and instincts makes him less human.\n",
      "* In Episode 16.0, \"All Good Things...\" (Scene: 31), Picard says to Data, \"I don't know how much longer I can stand this... This is not the man I was when I made you.\" This suggests that he feels a sense of loss and frustration with Data's development as an individual.\n",
      "* In Episode 9.0, \"Sins of the Father\" (Scene: 22), Picard questions Data's existence and whether they are truly his son. He also expresses concerns about Data's potential for self-discovery and growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Picard's views on Data reflect a paternalistic and sometimes paternalistic attitude towards him. While he acknowledges Data as an individual with his own thoughts and feelings, he also worries about the implications of their artificial creation and the consequences of their existence.\n"
